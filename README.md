## Huffman Coding

This repository contains an implementation of Huffman coding, a data compression algorithm, in C++.

## Overview

Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that is used to reduce the size of files without losing any information. It works by assigning variable-length codes to different characters based on their frequency of occurrence in the input text.

This implementation provides functions to compress and decompress text files using Huffman coding.

## File Structure

- `huffman_coding.cpp`: The main code file containing the implementation of Huffman coding.
- `sample.txt` and `harrypotter.txt`:input files for testing.
- `sample_compressed.txt` and `harrypotter_compressed.txt`: Compressed files generated after compression..
- `sample_decompressed.txt` and `harrypotter_decompressed.txt`: Decompressed files extracted from the compressed files.
